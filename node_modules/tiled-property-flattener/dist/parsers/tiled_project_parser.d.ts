/**
 * Parses a Tiled project file.
 *
 * Given a .tiled-project file in JSON format, it will parse all the classes of the file.
 *
 * By default, the parser will flatten nested properties into the root of the class,
 * mimicking inheritance in Tiled.
 *
 * If `@composite:` is prepended to the name of a property, then that property will not have its
 * properties flattened into the root.
 *
 * However, that property will remain composed under the root class and will flatten
 * its own nested properties into itself. This mimics composition in Tiled.
 *
 * The parser options can be used to change the behaviour of the parser, such as inverting the
 * default behaviour of flattening properties
 * (i.e. making all properties composite by default, unless `@inherit` is specified).
 *
 * @param jsonProjectFileData The JSON data of the project file. A file of the `.tiled-project`
 *  extension is already in JSON format.
 * @param parserOptions The options to customize the behaviour of the parser.
