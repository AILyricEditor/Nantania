/**
 * Merges two objects together, copying the properties from the second object into the first.
 *
 * If a property has a different value in the second object, the second object's value overwrites
 * the first.
 *
 * If a property is an object, the objects are merged recursively, so nested properties can
 * be merged or overwritten as well. This operates like the spread syntax, but is built for
 * nested objects.
 *
 * @param objectToMergeInto The object to merge the second object into. This will not be mutated.
 * @param objectToMergeWith The object to merge into the first object.
 * @returns A new object with the properties of both objects merged together.
